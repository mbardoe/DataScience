    "This technique is most useful when you want to compare some quantitative data across some categorical data (often we have more than two levels to our categorical variable). For instance in our Pace of Life survey. We could look at the DassTotal when we look at different grade level. The question we are answering here is if there is a significant difference between the means across these groups. \n",

    "So if we spoke about this in the language of hypothesis testing our hypothesis would be:\n",

    "    * H_a: At least one pair of means of the groups are different\n",

    "There are some assumptions that the data must meet to make the test be valid. These are:\n",

    "* Simple Random Sampling or independent observations\n",
    "* Independent groups\n",
    "* Standard deviation across groups are the same\n",
