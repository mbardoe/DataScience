# MA441-443 Plan for 2019-20

I think that we will look to include Cocalc, R, Excel(Sheets) through out the year next year.


Topics in order of study:


## MA441 (27 Lessons)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

* Data Definitions

  Day 1-3
  
  - Practice creating and displaying data: Students learn the basics of bar charts and histograms by interpreting the information from and day 1 survey. Most of this work is done in a spreadsheet software program such as Excel or Google Sheets. Introduce mean, median, mode, range, 5 number summaries. 
  
* Introduction to the Tools of Data Science

  Day 4-9
  
   - Students will learn about spreadsheets and Jupyter notebooks. They will learn to navigate these two systems, and learn about the pros an cons of each system. They will create and edit spreadsheets and notebooks. They will learn to write formulas and do calculations in each. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

* Introduction to Sampling and Error

  Day 10-13
  
  - Frogs or beads something about measuring something that cannot be realistically measured completely, but by doing sampling and simulation we can get a sense of the size and the possible error. This year we should do the simulation twice. There should be a hands on version of the simulation, but then we should find a way to make a computer simulation. This would be a place to introduce Cocalc. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
  
* Variation and Standard Deviation as a Ruler

  Day 14-17

  - Introduce the several ways to measure variation: IQR, variance, standard deviation, and range. Show how to utliize z-scores to talk about the relative "strangeness" of different scores. Use z-scores to compare disparate events.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

* Normal Distribution

  Day 18-23

  - Situations that lead the normal distribution. Central Limit Theorem. Normal calculations. Simulation with normal variables. Kingda-Ka. Jeans examples. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

* Linear Regression
  
  Day 24-27

  - Begin to discuss what makes something the "line of best fit". Explain $r^2$. Look at residual plots. Discuss the meaning of the coefficients of a linear regression. Discuss the output of linear regression from R. 

&nbsp;

* Term End Experience
