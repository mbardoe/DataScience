# Normal Jeans

Imagine that you are working for a company that is in the business of selling jeans in the US. Some numerical information to start with:

* Possible number of men’s jeans sold: 2 million (all possible sizes)
* Possible Number of women’s jeans sold: 3 million (all possible sizes)
* Wholesale price of the men’s jeans that you sell: \$25
* Wholesale price of the women’s jeans that you sell: \$27

*If you need more quantitative information than has been provided, ask*. 

* The price to make the men’s jeans is given by a \$150,000 set up cost for each different size, and then each jean that is made costs \$12 in labor and material.

* The price to make the women’s jeans is given by a \$170,000 set up cost for each different size, and then each jean that is made costs $16 in labor and material.

Do some research about the typical measurements of men and women. The CDC puts out this information that is then used to determine ways to fit the standard person. Look for information about the mean and standard deviation of waists and inseams. Use this information about size of adults in the United States to determine which sizes you will make, and the number of each size of jean that should be made and then sold, and finally estimate your total profit for the year.

Write a short report on your findings. Highlight the areas that are the greatest profit centers and the areas that are weakest. Include a clear spreadsheet of the calculations that you did to determine the numbers in your report.
