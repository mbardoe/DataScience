## Practice 1					
Name: _____________________


1.	Researchers at the Fish and Wildlife Service go out and do capture recapture at Lake Trout. They tag and release 100 fish. The return to the lake a week later, and then capture 500 more fish. Of the fish that they capture 20 are tagged. 



 - a. What is our point-estimate of the number of fish in the lake?

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


  - b.	What might have been the purpose of waiting a week to after they tagged the original fish?

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;





  - c.	When they returned to the office they did a simulation with different numbers of fish in the lake to try to put some bounds on the range of fish in the lake. Their data is presented below. What is a reasonable range for the number of fish in the lake.

3.	In November 2003 Discover published an article on the colonies of ants. They reported some basic information about many species of ants and the results of some discoveries found by myrmecologist Walter Tschinkel of the University of Florida. Information included the scientific name of the ant species, the geographic location, the depth of the nest (in feet), the number of chambers in the nest, and the number of ants in the colony. The article documented how new ant colonies begin, the ant-nest design, and how nests differ in shape, number, size of chambers, and how they are connected, depending on the species. It reported that nest designs include vertical, horizontal, or inclined tunnels for movement and transport of food and ants.
