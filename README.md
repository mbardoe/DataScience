## Data Science at Choate

The idea of this repo is to manage the resources of the Data Science class at Choate Rosemary Hall. The course is intended for seniors and other upper form students that are more interested in the practical application of math than in working through more technical mathematical content. In this course we work through how to deal with quantitative information in ways that are useful, graphical, explanatory, and informative. There is an emphasis on displaying data and simulating situations.
