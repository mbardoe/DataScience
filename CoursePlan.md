# MA441-443 Plan for 2019-20

I think that we will look to include Cocalc, R, Excel(Sheets) through out the year next year.


Topics in order of study:


## MA441 (27 Lessons)
* Data Definitions

  Day 1-3
  
  - Practice creating and displaying data: Students learn the basics of bar charts and histograms by interpreting the information from and day 1 survey. Most of this work is done in a spreadsheet software program such as Excel or Google Sheets. Introduce mean, median, mode, range, 5 number summaries. 
  
  
* Introduction to Sampling and Error

  Day 4-9
  
  - Frogs or beads something about measuring something that cannot be realistically measured completely, but by doing sampling and simulation we can get a sense of the size and the possible error. This year we should do the simulation twice. There should be a hands on version of the simulation, but then we should find a way to make a computer simulation. This would be a place to introduce Cocalc. 
  
  
* Variation and Standard Deviation as a Ruler

  Day 10-13

  - Introduce the several ways to measure variation: IQR, variance, standard deviation, and range. Show how to utliize z-scores to talk about the relative "strangeness" of different scores. Use z-scores to compare disparate events.
  
  
* Normal Distribution

  Day 14-19

  - Situations that lead the normal distribution. Central Limit Theorem. Normal calculations. Simulation with normal variables. Kingda-Ka. Jeans examples. 
  
 
* Linear Regression
  
  Day 20-25
